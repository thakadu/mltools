Very simple csv to arff file converter.

Only numeric and string types are supported at present.

Usage:

$ python csv2arff.py filename Relationname Typespec

Relationname is the string that will appear in the @relation line
in the arff file.
Typespec is a comma separated list of types which represent
the types of the data columns and will be used to
generate the @attribute lines of the arff file.
No type checking is done, it is up to the user to
ensure correct types. Valid types are string and numeric.

Example Usage:

Suppose you have a csv file prices.csv with following lines:

TickerSymbol, Price
APPL, 360.56
YHOO, 19.19
GOOG, 540.28

The following command:

$ python csv2arff.py prices.csv StockPrices string,numeric --header > prices.arff

will produce a file prices.arff with content similar to this:
